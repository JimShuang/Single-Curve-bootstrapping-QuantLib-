# Single-Curve-bootstrapping-QuantLib-
Use Cash, Future and swaps to bootstrap the Libor curves.
compare the different interpolation methods and shows that the LogLinearDiscount is step forward (in BBG).
Finally test the accuracy of the curve bootstrapping by repricing of the curve instruments (swaps).
